# Project: Ice island drift, deterioration and detection 
# Descrition: Function to convert processed/standardized csv beacon data to a summarized
# text file. Called on by BeaconProcessing.R  
#
# Necessary file: Standardized beacon csv. This should be kept in an 
# 'output' directory with other processed data files. Writte there with beacon_processing.R
