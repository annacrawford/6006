This program is designed to digest raw tracking beacon data in csv format to output a standardized csv file and other quality added
file types, detailed below.

3 Directories are recommended within your main beacon directory: "RawBeaconData", "ProcessedBeaconData" and "Scripts"

At the command line, navigate to your main directory. 
Keep the driver script (BeaconProcessing.R) in this main directory

Command line: input directory, output directory, program directory, filename, beacon type

input = where raw data is kept (use full path, e.g. /tank/HOME/acrawford/6006/RawBeaconData)
output = where processed data will be written to (e.g., /tank/HOME/acrawford/6006/ProcessedBeaconData)
program directory (prgdir) = where scripts (except driver script) are kept (e.g., /tank/HOME/acrawford/6006/Scripts)
filename = name of raw beacon data csv file, without extension ('47551', NOT '47551.csv')
beacon type = one of: Sailwx, Joubeh, Iridium, Oceanetics, Canatec

Expected output: a standardized csv file, shp/shx/prj/dbf files (line and point), gpx files (line and point), kml files (line and point), 
A pdf with: PolarPlot (png), SpeedPlot (png) and cummulative speed probability plot (png), 
A text ice island statistics file

Troubleshooting: 
1) If Sailwx beacons do not run correctly during the standardization phase, check that there is not a left-over comma at the end of the header line. 

2) If this statement is written to the log: "Error in writeOGR(Dataset, paste(getwd(), paste(filename, "_pt", ".kml",  : 
  layer exists, use a new layer name
Calls: csv2kml -> writeOGR
Execution halted"

Go into your ProcessedBeaconData directory and remove kml files already written for that beacon. kml files cannot be overwritten. 

3) Possible errors: Assertion statement on line 131 (Validation function). If comes back false in command line window it means that there is an error with the standardized csv column data types.

4) Necessary packages are listed between Lines 25-35 of BeaconProcessing.R. Please load these if they are not already on your system. 

To add another beacon type, you must: 
1) Create a new function script to standardize the raw csv data to the standardized format (see Sailwx2csv, Iridium2csv, etc. for 
templates)

2) Add this function to the sourced functions in BeaconProcessing.R (line 46)

3) Add this function to raw2csv.R, along with the appropriate 'if' statement (e.g., if (beaconType == "Sailwx") {
      Sailwx2csv(Drift))

4) Add the beaconType to the list of valid command line options at line 96: valid = c("Joubeh", "Iridium", "Sailwx", "Oceanetics", "Canatec")

5) Add the beaconType to the list of available options at the command line (beginning of this document). 

Error handling and logging
Errors are logged to the output directory in BeaconProcessingLog.txt. It is appendable and messages will be compiled with every run. A timestamp is logged with each run WHERE AN ERROR OCCURS. No logging will occur if there is no errors or warnings are initiated.  

Errors that will halt to program include:
1) An incorrect number of command line arguments

2) beaconType argument is incorrect (not a possible option)

3) If there is an error reading in the beacon data

4) The standardized csv columns having incorrect data types

5) Attempting to force the program to overwrite kml files in the output directry 

6) Rplots.pdf not being written

Errors that will log but allow the program to continue include:

1) The gps_time column of the standardized csv being the incorrect format

2) The gps_time column of the standardized csv not being in chronological order

Version control: 
A. Crawford has implemented Git and GitHub for version control. See associated document written for GEOG 6007 in April 2014.
