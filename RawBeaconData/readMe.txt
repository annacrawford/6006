For Joubeh data - make sure that lat and lon columns are in decimal degrees. The settings in the Joubeh
asset management system: asset.joubeh.com, can be modified to do this automatically

In Iridium csv files - the first column (IMEI) most be formatted as #.####E+14, Not the full IMEI #. This can be
