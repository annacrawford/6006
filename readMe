This program is designed to digest raw tracking beacon data in csv format to output a standardized csv file and other quality added
file types, detailed below.

3 Directories are recommended within your main beacon directory: "RawBeaconData", "ProcessedBeaconData" and "Scripts"

In the command line, navigate to your main directory. 
Keep the driver script in this main directory

Command line: input directory, output directory, program directory, filename, beacon type

input = where raw data is kept (i.e., RawBeaconData)
output = where processed data will be written to (i.e., ProcessedBeaconData)
program directory (prgdir) = where scripts are kept
filename = name of raw beacon data csv file, without extension ('47551', NOT '47551.csv')
beacon type = one of: Sailwx, Joubeh, Iridium, Oceanetics, Canatec

** output and prgdir must be described in full (i.e., /tank/HOME/acrawford/6006/Scripts) **

Expected output: a standardized csv file, shp/shx/prj/dbf files (line and point), gpx files (line and point), kml files (line and point), 
PolarPlot (png), SpeedPlot (png), Cummulative speed probability plot (png), and a text ice island statistics file

Troubleshooting: 
1) If Sailwx beacons do not run correctly during the standardization phase, check that there is not a left-over comma at the end of the header line. 

2) If this statement returned: "Error in writeOGR(Dataset, paste(getwd(), paste(filename, "_pt", ".kml",  : 
  layer exists, use a new layer name
Calls: csv2kml -> writeOGR
Execution halted"

Go into your ProcessedBeaconData directory and remove kml files already written for that beacon. kml files cannot be overwritten. 

3) Possible errors: Assertion statement on line X. If comes back false in command line window it means that there is an error
with the standardized csv column data types
